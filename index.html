    <div class="about">
      <p><strong>Symbol:  WEBDN</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Decimals:  </strong> Just two. That's all we need</p>
      <p><strong>Mintable:  </strong> Nope, the 1 trillion minted is all there will ever be</p>
      <p><strong>Launch:  </strong> 50% staked at low volume, it can only go up</p>
      <p><strong>Philosophy:  </strong> Simplicity</p>
      <br><p>There's no need for the excess of decimals that exist in crypto, especially for tokens that have a quadrillion supply and are worth less than a cent as it is.  Computer Dinero is exactly what it claims
      to be, money used for the Solana network that is easy for people to read, with a trillion supply, just 2 decimals, and straight forward tokenomics.  We launched half the pool, 500 billion tokens, so the buyable amount represents
      a fair amount of the total supply.  When trading volume goes up, and we receive Computer Dinero from gas fees, we will readd that money to the liquidity pool along with the solana, or give it back 
      in the form of holder staking.</p>
